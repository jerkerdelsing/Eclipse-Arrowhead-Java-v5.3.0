# ConsumerAuthorization
## System Design Description
Eclipse Arrowhead 5.2.2 | core system | Revision 2026-11-09 | REVIEW DRAFT
## Purpose and document structure
This document describes implementation ownership, architecture, persistence, security and operational boundaries.
The current cross-language sections below precede the detailed implementation appendices. Appendix dates and release labels belong to the retained baseline, not to a newly qualified release. Existing descriptions have been assembled from the primary trees; no live interoperability or semantic-parity claim is made.
## Java implementation
Primary folder: Eclipse-Arrowhead-java/ah5-core-java-spring/consumer-authorization.
1 detailed Java SysDD source document(s) are included in the appendices. Their architecture, operation parameters, models, transport bindings, access rules and errors remain associated with Java. They must not be read as automatically implemented by the ports.
## Go implementation
Primary folder: Eclipse-Arrowhead-go/ah5-core-go/consumer-authorization.
### ConsumerAuthorization — Go 5.2.2
Standalone core system, reorganized on 2026-10-28 following the Eclipse-Arrowhead-java distribution layout.
Build and operate from this folder; no original Arrowhead checkout or sibling source module is required.
The executable is `bin/ConsumerAuthorization`. Entry point: `./cmd/consumer-authorization`. Module: `arrowhead/ah5-core-go/consumer-authorization`. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for configuration and standalone container use. Existing compatibility limits remain in the copied upstream documentation and [UPSTREAM-README.md](UPSTREAM-README.md).
Existing role selection and API behavior are retained.
Documentation and license notices are included in this folder. Source provenance and import-only rewrites are listed in the distribution's SOURCE-MANIFEST.json. No running cloud or upstream source was changed.
### Listening port
Built-in default **127.0.0.1:8445** (Arrowhead default). The shipped `config.json` sets `"listen": "0.0.0.0:8445"`. Override with `"listen"` in the configuration file, `SERVER_PORT=N` or `-server.port N`; the port overrides keep the configured host.
See [LISTENING-PORTS.md](../../LISTENING-PORTS.md) for precedence and all systems.
### Detailed implementation evidence
0 native Go SysDD document(s) are included in the appendices. Their protocol and storage descriptions apply to that implementation only. Current primary-folder ownership and current listening-port notes above supersede historical paths or example ports in those retained documents.
### Native compatibility profile
### Compatibility profile and remaining work

This document is deliberately separate from the route inventory. It records the actual implemented behavior and material gaps, rather than calling a set of HTTP handlers a complete Java replacement.

#### Implemented

- Authentication: PASSWORD identities, bcrypt cost 10, batch management, credential changes, credential-authenticated logout, UUID sessions, one active session per identity, expiration checks, session query/closure and identity query filters. Credentials and session tokens are excluded from management responses. Credential changes and management updates invalidate sessions (a stricter security choice).
- ConsumerAuthorization: provider and MGMT policy levels, MGMT precedence, ALL/WHITELIST/BLACKLIST/SYS_METADATA policies, scoped/default fallback, all-scopes checks, grant/lookup/query/revoke/check operations. Missing policies deny access.
- Authorization tokens: usage/time-limited tokens; URL-base64 self-contained tokens with the Java pipe-separated field order; RS256/RS512 JWTs with `psn/csn/ccn/tat/tan/sco` claims; public-key export; management generation/query/revocation; provider-bound online verification with atomic usage decrement. Raw tokens are returned only at generation, not retained for later retrieval.
- Encryption-key registration: Java AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding and AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding wire encodings, provider-specific IVs for CBC, owner/management removal. Provider keys are authenticated-encrypted at rest with AES-GCM and provider identity as additional authenticated data. The server certificate's RSA key signs JWTs.
- Simple orchestration: consumer-specific store, unique priorities per consumer/service, priority modification, preferred providers, ONLY_PREFERRED, per-service MATCHMAKING, ignored-field/flag warnings, pull/history.
- Dynamic orchestration: service discovery through ServiceRegistry, mandatory authorization checks, preferred providers, interface operations, token acquisition, MATCHMAKING, provider-consented exclusivity capped by `allowExclusivity`, atomic lock conflict rechecks, lock management, pull/history.
- Both orchestrators: persisted subscriptions, owner checks, management subscription/query/unsubscribe/trigger operations, persisted jobs and HTTPS push callbacks. Callback TLS is pinned to the target system identity before sending results. Interrupted in-progress jobs become ERROR on restart instead of being redelivered automatically.
- General management: sanitized configuration map, bounded persisted audit log querying, authenticated echo. Source-generated service descriptions and opt-in periodic service registration.
- Shared runtime: mandatory local-cloud mTLS, identity-token certificate binding, fixed authority identity pinning before credentials, redirect rejection, coalesced login refresh, conditional token invalidation, body limits, server timeouts, atomic JSON snapshots and exclusive process ownership of a state file.
- ServiceRegistry: pre-existing Go implementation plus corrected `AuthorizationVerifyRequestDTO` fields/operation names and removal of an implicit Sysop-name privilege escalation in outsourced token verification. Its original configuration and publisher are preserved.

#### Not implemented / not equivalent

1. **MQTT APIs (since 2026-10-24) differ from Java in three deliberate points**: the response topic must lie under
   `arrowhead/response/<requester>/`, requests with an invalid identity token are not answered (no 401 response), and
   identity login/logout/change stay HTTPS only. Request topics, envelopes, operation names and error payloads follow
   the Java MQTT API; see "Changes 2026-10-24 (MQTT)".
2. **Dynamic federation, translation and QoS integration are absent.** Requests that enable ALLOW_INTERCLOUD, ONLY_INTERCLOUD or ALLOW_TRANSLATION, or supply QoS requirements, fail explicitly with 501. They are not silently treated as successful local equivalents. Foreign-consumer management token generation also returns 501. This is unsuitable for a federated orchestration replacement until those paths are ported and tested.
3. **Blacklist support and authorization-driven management filters are not ported** to the four new systems. Management uses identity sysop privileges or an explicit whole-management whitelist. This is less granular than per-operation authorization; do not use the whitelist as a substitute for fine-grained policy enforcement.
4. **The new systems do not yet publish native sysMonitor/AMQP telemetry.** Their echo APIs and history/logs exist, but they will not satisfy a LocalCloudManager native-telemetry readiness requirement. The existing ServiceRegistry publisher remains available.
5. **No Java SQL database compatibility/import.** Each new system uses a private atomic JSON state file, not JPA/MySQL. Never mount a Java database volume as a Go state file. Java identity, authorization, key, store, lock, subscription and history data need a separately reviewed importer before migration.
6. **Configuration is JSON**, not Spring properties, environment override semantics, keystores or Java's full property catalog. `get-config` returns a sanitized native configuration subset in the Java `map` response wrapper. There is no cloud registration health/readiness gate; registration failures are retried and reported to the process log.
7. **Validation/normalization and query semantics are not exhaustively matched.** Supply canonical names and enum spelling. Field lengths, case normalization, HTTP error details/statuses, empty/null distinctions, ordering/default page sizes and warning text still need Java golden-contract tests. Pagination is bounded, but is not a full port of Java's per-entity paging service. JSON inputs use dynamic documents rather than generated, exhaustive DTO validation.
8. Metadata supports the documented comparisons and dotted/indexed paths, but REGEXP uses Go RE2, not Java Pattern; lookarounds/backreferences are not supported. Mixed-type numeric/collection edge cases need further Java fixture tests.
9. Dynamic candidate ranking is deterministic local/preferred ordering, not the complete Java matchmaking/QoS/fallback pipeline. Scopes are checked fail-closed; a denied requested operation can reject orchestration instead of yielding Java's precise partial-result behavior. Token acquisition is not rolled back if a later lock conflict aborts orchestration.
10. Push uses one worker and one delivery attempt, without Java's Quartz/thread-pool behavior, HTTP/plain MQTT callbacks, retries, or automatic event-driven re-orchestration. HTTPS result-delivery behavior is tested; duplicate delivery avoidance does not constitute exactly-once delivery. Notifications interrupted by a crash are reported as uncertain ERROR.
11. Logs are native bounded audit records (1,000 retained), not the full Java logging database or JVM-specific exceptions. Sessions/tokens/jobs/subscriptions/locks are validated for expiry at access but do not have complete Java cleaner/retention policies; state can grow over time. Expired entities may differ in query visibility.
12. No certificate revocation enforcement beyond Go's ordinary certificate-chain/time/hostname checks. No blacklist, rate limiter, distributed transactions, HA, distributed locks, SQL migration, or production security certification. Offline self-contained token revocation requires provider-side expiration/revocation handling; online revocation does not invalidate already-issued offline tokens.

#### Release gate

Do not describe this profile as fully interchangeable with the Java cloud. Before replacement: implement the required missing capabilities, compare successful and failing requests against Java for every DTO/operation, verify all discovery/security policies, migrate data with rollback, verify monitoring/UI readiness and federation, and rerun the cloud security evaluation. None of those deployment changes is made by this source delivery.

#### Changes 2026-10-17 (GoCloud deployment)

- Dynamic orchestration passes each requested operation as an authorization scope; a provider qualifies only if
  every requested operation is granted. Without operations the all-scopes check applies (as before). Test:
  `TestNativeServiceRegistryIntegration`.
- Deployed in Arrowhead-test-cloud-go (see its GO-NATIVE-FULL-2026-10-17.md) by operator decision, with the gaps
  listed above accepted; the release gate above is not thereby satisfied.

- Inter-cloud orchestration: ALLOW_INTERCLOUD (fallback when no local provider) and ONLY_INTERCLOUD through the local
  Gatekeeper (`gatekeeperURL`): globalServiceDiscovery query, interCloudNegotiation negotiate, GateTunnel interface
  result. ALLOW_TRANSLATION and QoS requirements still return 501.
- Native sysMonitor telemetry (`monitorEnabled`, `amqpURL`): sysMonitor offer on generic_amqps, echo/power/status.
- `managementPolicy: authorization`: ConsumerAuthorization decides management access per service and operation.
- Requested operations match string-set operations (MQTT/AMQP templates) as well as HTTP operation maps.
- Push subscriptions store `notifyRecipient`: a non-sysop management subscriber (orchestration by proxy) receives
  the result; own and sysop subscriptions deliver to the target.

#### Changes 2026-10-24 (translation)

- ALLOW_TRANSLATION: an interface is translatable when it does not match the template or property requirements
  natively (as Java assortInterfacesAndMarkIfNonNative), so a bridge can also translate only the data model of the
  accepted template (generic_https senml -> generic_https simpleJson). Native candidates still win; the consumer's
  authorization for the provider is still checked before a bridge is built.

#### Changes 2026-10-24 (MQTT)

- MQTT API of all five core systems (`internal/core/mqtt.go`, `ServiceRegistry/mqtt.go`), the Java `mqtt.api.enabled`
  counterpart: the Java request envelope (MqttRequestTemplate: traceId, authentication `IDENTITY-TOKEN//<token>`,
  responseTopic, qosRequirement, params, payload) on the Java base topics + operation
  (`arrowhead/serviceregistry/{device-discovery,system-discovery,service-discovery,management,general/management,
  monitor}/`, `arrowhead/authentication/identity/[management/]`, `arrowhead/consumer-authorization/authorization[-token]/
  [management/]`, `arrowhead/serviceorchestration/orchestration/[management/{push,history,lock,store,plant-rules}/]`,
  `general/management/`, `monitor/echo`); the response (MqttResponseTemplate: status, traceId, receiver, payload; errors
  as ErrorMessageDTO with exceptionType and origin = topic) goes to the request's response topic.
- The adapter verifies the identity token and runs the request in process through the HTTPS route, so the blacklist,
  management (whitelist/authorization) checks and handlers are the same as over HTTPS. Path parameters come from
  `params` (a single one also from a string payload, as Java), the other params become the query, a list payload of a
  removal operation is its list parameter (names, instanceIds, uuids, ids, tokenReferences, systemNames,
  serviceInstances, keys).
- Response binding (Go): the response topic must lie under `arrowhead/response/<system of the token>/`; with a broker
  ACL that lets each client read only its own prefix, a stolen token cannot be used to read answers.
- Configuration: `mqttURL` (ssl://host:port, client certificate = system certificate) and `mqttTopicPrefix` (a second
  orchestrator on the same broker needs another prefix); ServiceRegistry `mqtt.api.enabled`, `mqtt.broker.address`,
  `mqtt.broker.port`, `mqtt.topic.prefix` (requires TLS and the outsourced policy). With MQTT enabled every service is
  also registered with a `generic_mqtts` interface (baseTopic, operation list), as Java.
- ServiceRegistry: the Blacklist filter never checks Blacklist itself (Java BlacklistFilter); a Java Blacklist, which
  registers before it serves its check, was refused under `force.blacklist.filter`.
- `cmd/mqtt-call`: command-line client for one MQTT API request (tests).

## Rust implementation
Primary folder: Eclipse-Arrowhead-rust/ah5-core-rust/consumer-authorization.
### ConsumerAuthorization (Rust)
Arrowhead 5.2.2 core system. `src/main.rs` is built as binary `consumer-authorization` by the `arrowhead-core-rust` crate in `..`. `consumer-authorization.json` and `documentation/` link to `../examples` and `../documentation/ConsumerAuthorization`.
### Detailed implementation evidence
1 native Rust SysDD document(s) are included in the appendices. Their protocol and storage descriptions apply to that implementation only. Current primary-folder ownership and current listening-port notes above supersede historical paths or example ports in those retained documents.
### Build and state ownership
Core entry points are built by arrowhead-core-rust; the ordinary support entry points are built by arrowhead-support-rust using the shared support runtime. LocalCloudManager has its own crate. Per-system documentation links may point into the shared documentation catalog. Independent identity and state configuration is still required. Read the native appendix for persistence and restart semantics.
## Cross-language qualification
Identical system names or HTTP paths do not establish interoperability. For the selected implementation, verify registered service versions and metadata, method/path and payload models, null and optional-field handling, success/error bodies, authentication and per-operation authorization, timeout/retry behavior and persistence across restart. Java MQTT/AMQP descriptions apply to a port only where its own implementation evidence explicitly supports them. Missing transports must not be advertised.
State conversion from Java SQL to native snapshots, secret provisioning, backup/restore and rollback require implementation-specific procedures. No data migration, deployment or cloud reconfiguration was performed for this document set.
## Detailed appendices and provenance
